# RL-Agent (Breakout)
In this project I have implemented Deep Q learning algorithm for training an agent to play the famout Atari Game, Breakout. Although it is for Breakout but the technique can be universally applied to any other Atari Game. 
I have watched the DeepMind Videos of David Silver for theoretical knowledge and also watched Andrew Ng courses on Deep Neural Network and Convulational Neural Networks.
The major points to be noted are - 
<ul>
  <li>Implementation of Deep Neural Network which include several Convulational Layers and FC Layers with ReLU as the activation function</li>
  <li>Use of epsilon-Greedy Policy Improvement</li>
  <li>Use of Adam Optimiser from Pytorch</li>
  <li>Use of Experience replay and temporal difference for calculating the mean squared error loss</li>
</ul>

Many other things were learnt apart from the DQN Algorithm like - YOLO Algorithm, Markov Decision Process, Monte Carlo and Dynamic Programming approach to Reinforcement Learning, etc
